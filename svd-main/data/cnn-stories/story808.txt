'Colbert Report' to resume production
Comedy Central aired repeat episodes of the hit TV show last week because of what it described then as "unforeseen circumstances." "Colbert Report abruptly suspends production and I fall into a deep depression. Related?" actor Josh Adams tweeted. While Colbert hasn't made any public statements on the suspension, he posted a message on Twitter. On Friday, he wrote: "My family and I would like to thank everyone who has offered their thoughts and prayers. We are grateful and touched by your concern."
