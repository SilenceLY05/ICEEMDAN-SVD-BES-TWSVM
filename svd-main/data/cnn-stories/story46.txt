Drunk driving charge for Bobby Brown
Brown, 43, showed signs of intoxication and failed a field sobriety test during the traffic stop at 12:20 p.m. in the Reseda area of Los Angeles County, Officer Tiana Reed said. He was taken to the Los Angeles Police station in Van Nuys, where he was booked on a charge of driving under the influence, Reed said. Brown was released later Monday after several hours in custody, according to a California Highway Patrol spokesman. Brown, the ex-husband of the late singer Whitney Houston, is scheduled to perform with his group New Edition on Thursday in St. Louis.
