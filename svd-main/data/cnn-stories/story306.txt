School bus, truck collide in Pennsylvania
At least one person was killed in the crash, Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Scott Kovach said. Medical helicopters were transporting six students to hospitals, said Geraldine Budzina, a dispatcher with Somerset County 911. Two other school buses were taking 22 students with less serious injuries to a hospital, she said. As many as 70 students may have been on the school bus, she said.
