Body of Arkansas 4-year-old found
Caleb Linn's remains were found in the South Fork River in northern Arkansas, according to Fulton County Sheriff's dispatcher Arles Lenderman. No foul play was suspected in his disappearance. Two T-shirts worn by Caleb were found Tuesday afternoon along the river at the Boy Scout camp where he was last seen, officials said. "We had pictures of the boy when we he went missing. They were the same clothes he was wearing that day," Sheriff Buck Foley said. Caleb's family was devastated by the loss of a boy they described as having a genial disposition. "He was full of life," stepfather Randy Muir told CNN affiliate KARK. "He was an amazing young kid." CNN affiliate KATV reported that the boy was last seen by his aunt on Saturday at Kia Kima Scout Reservation. Caleb had asked whether he could catch up with some other children who had gone back to a cabin area about 300 yards away, according to the station. The search covered about 1,000 acres, Foley said. The camp is near the Arkansas-Missouri border, about 160 miles north of Little Rock. Caleb's aunt and mother identified the clothes as the little boy's, Foley said.
