Police: Student shot, another in custody
An 8-year-old girl suffered a gunshot wound at Armin Jahr Elementary School, said Bremerton police Lt. Pete Fisher. Her condition was not immediately known. She was airlifted to a local hospital. The incident occurred at about 1:30 p.m. PT (4:30 p.m. ET), police said. The school was placed on lockdown for a time. The gun was recovered, Fisher said. No further information on the suspected shooter was released. "It is far too early in investigation to release details at this point," Fisher told reporters. CNN Seattle affiliate KING said the wounded girl is in the third grade. School officials in Bremerton, west of Seattle, did not immediately return a message left by CNN.
