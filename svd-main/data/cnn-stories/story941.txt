5.8 quake reported off Costa Rica
The quake's epicenter was nearly 50 miles (75 kilometers) south of the capital city, San Jose, the survey said. The quake was about 17 miles (28 kilometers) below the Earth's surface, and its epicenter was just off the country's southwestern coast. It struck about 4:55 a.m. local time (5:55 a.m. ET), according to the geological survey. There were no immediate reports of damages or injuries. The agency estimated a higher magnitude for the quake earlier Monday in a preliminary reading.
