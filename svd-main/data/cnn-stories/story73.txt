7.2-magnitude quake hits central Chile
There were no immediate reports of major damage. The earthquake was at a depth of 21.6 miles (34.8 km) and struck 16 miles (27 km) north-northwest of Talca, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It had originally reported the quake was offshore and had a magnitude of 7.2. No tsunami warning was issued and authorities initially canceled an evacuation order that had been issued for parts of the coast. They reissued that order late Sunday as a preventative measure. Three people were injured as a result of the quake, emergency officials said. One person was in a traffic accident in the Biobio region and two people sustained light injuries when a ceiling collapsed. Talca was one of the cities hit hard by a devastating 8.8-magnitude earthquake in 2010.
