Comic Gallagher has heart attack at club
"We will not know the outcome until sometime tomorrow," Christine Scherrer said. Gallagher, 65, is in stable condition at an undisclosed Dallas-area hospital, Scherrer said. He was about to go onstage Wednesday at Hat Tricks, a Lewisville, Texas, club, when he fell ill and was taken to a hospital by paramedics, she said. "His family is with him and Hat Tricks has been unbelievable with the help and support with everything," Scherrer said. His shows in Texas, Oklahoma and Oregon scheduled through next week have been postponed, she said.
